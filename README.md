# ElectricMotor
A simulation of an Electric motor to extract data responsible to failure.

## Installation

Use git clone to download 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OnlyMeST/ElectricMotor.git
```

## Usage

* Use as a staring point for creating an advanced physics Simulation.
* Use the Data extracted by me to train an AI Model for Predictive maintenance.

## Warning

This project is highly theoretical, the data extracted by this simulation is nowhere near perfect. Do not use without cleaning.
